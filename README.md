## Car Insurance Analysis
Car insurance is an essential service that provides financial protection for car owners and drivers. Insurance companies collect and analyze data on policyholders to gain insights into their behavior, demographics, and claims. By analyzing this data, car insurance companies can improve their marketing strategies and develop products that meet the needs of their customers.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze a car insurance dataset using SQL queries to answer relevant business questions. By analyzing policyholder demographics and claims, we can gain insights into policyholder behavior and characteristics. The insights gained from the analysis can help car insurance companies improve their marketing strategies and product offerings.

## Dataset
The dataset includes information on policyholder demographics, car details, and claims. The dataset is large and contains a wide range of variables, including policyholder age, gender, car make and model, coverage type, and claims information.

## Dashboard

The [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/vivek.singh3442/viz/insurance_16803514901140/Dashboard4?publish=yes) is interactive and provides valuable insights into policyholder behavior and characteristics, including age distribution, car make and model popularity, and claims patterns.

## Conclusion
By analyzing the car insurance dataset using SQL queries, we were able to gain valuable insights into policyholder demographics and claims. The insights gained from the analysis can help car insurance companies improve their marketing strategies and develop products that meet the needs of their customers. The dashboard provides an easy-to-use interface for exploring the data and generating custom reports, making it a valuable tool for car insurance companies' marketing teams.
